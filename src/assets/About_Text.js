const About_Text = `
Hi, Iâ€™m Ali Hassan, a passionate Frontend Engineer who loves crafting beautiful and user-friendly web experiences using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. I thrive on building interactive interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.

I enjoy learning and exploring modern frontend frameworks, particularly React.js, and I take pride in efficiently handling API integrations, testing endpoints with Postman, and ensuring seamless user experiences across projects.

My future goals involve mastering advanced frontend patterns, optimizing web performance, and contributing to projects that make a tangible impact on users. I'm also deeply motivated by creating engaging web solutions that provide real value.

Outside of coding, I enjoy connecting with fellow developers, sharing knowledge through my personal projects, and exploring creative ideas that push the boundaries of modern web development.
