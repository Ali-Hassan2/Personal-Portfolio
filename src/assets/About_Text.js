const About_Text = `
Hi, I’m Ali Hassan, a dedicated Computer Science student with a passion for solving real-world problems through creativity and innovation. I thrive on learning and exploring new ideas, constantly pushing myself to grow both personally and professionally.

I have a strong interest in teaching and mentoring, as I believe knowledge becomes more meaningful when shared. Currently, I’m teaching Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) while also working on my personal and academic projects.

My future aspirations involve specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), where I aim to contribute to groundbreaking solutions that impact the world positively. I'm also deeply motivated by my desire to give back to my community and support meaningful causes.

Outside of academics, I enjoy building connections, creating content for my brand EACODE, and imagining innovative ideas to bring into reality.
